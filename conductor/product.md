## Vision
To provide a high-performance, automated trading platform that empowers traders and developers to implement and verify complex Inner Circle Trader (ICT) concepts with reliability and precision on the Binance Futures market.

## Target Audience
- **Retail Traders**: Seeking automated tools for ICT concepts like Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and Order Blocks (OB).
- **Developers**: Needing a modular, extensible framework to build or test custom trading logic.
- **Strategy Researchers**: Requiring accurate data and backtesting capabilities to refine trading models.

## Core Features & Goals
1. **ICT Strategy Mastery**: Accurate detection and execution of liquidity-based strategies (FVG, OB, Liquidity Sweeps).
2. **System Performance**: Low-latency WebSocket data handling and high-reliability order execution using an event-driven model.
3. **Advanced Risk Management**: Integrated position sizing, risk controls, and protection against liquidation or excessive drawdown.
4. **Modularity**: A clean, testable architecture that separates core engine, strategy, and risk logic.

## Success Criteria
- **Operational Stability**: 24/7 uptime in paper or live trading without data loss or unexpected crashes.
- **Code Quality**: High test coverage (>80%), clear documentation, and adherence to Pythonic best practices.
- **Execution Precision**: Signals generated by strategies match actual trade executions with minimal slippage.

## Roadmap Priorities
- **Strategy Expansion**: Adding more sophisticated ICT patterns and multi-timeframe analysis indicators.
